# Project Description
**Abstract: Due to the internet’s widespread accessibility, more and more businesses are bringing their services online. Besides, because of the growth of E-commerce websites, both individuals and businesses that deal in finances are more dependent on internet administrations to handle their business. Since more and more people are using online banking and making purchases online, credit card fraud has increased. Fraudsters can also use anything to disrupt the existing fraud detection system’s systematic operation. This research seeks to develop an efficient fraud detection system by utilizing machine learning (ML) models that are responsive to shifting patterns of customer behavior and have a tendency to reduce fraud manipulation through the identification and filtering of fraudulent activity in real time. The techniques in our research include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost and Hybrid models. This research suggests that the Random Forest, as well as Hybrid(AdaBoost + Random Forest) models, are the most effective algorithm with an accuracy of 99.99% among many others. We have used SHAP to illustrate the explainability of our best models.**
